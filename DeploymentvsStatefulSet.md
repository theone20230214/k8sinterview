⚙️ **Kubernetes / Workload Types – Deployment vs StatefulSet**
**Question:**
What are the differences between a Deployment and a StatefulSet in Kubernetes? When would you choose one over the other?

---

### ✅ Look for:

* **Deployment** manages stateless applications; all Pods are interchangeable and have no persistent identity.
* **StatefulSet** manages stateful applications; Pods have **stable hostnames, persistent storage**, and are deployed in a defined order.
* Use **Deployment** for web services, APIs, or frontends.
* Use **StatefulSet** for databases, queues, or applications needing **stable network IDs and storage**.

### Full Score Answer (Score: 5)

A **Deployment** is designed for stateless workloads where Pods are interchangeable. Each Pod can be replaced at any time and has no unique identity. All Pods share the same name pattern, and they can be recreated in any order.

A **StatefulSet**, on the other hand, is used for **stateful applications**. Each Pod in a StatefulSet has a **stable network identity** (like `pod-0`, `pod-1`, etc.), and it can retain its own **persistent volume** even after being deleted or rescheduled. StatefulSets also ensure **ordered deployment and scaling**, which is important for services like databases or clustered systems.

Use a Deployment when your application doesn't require persistent state or unique identities—like web servers. Use StatefulSet when your app needs to retain state across restarts, such as a PostgreSQL or Kafka cluster.

### ⚠️ Medium Answer (Score: 3)

Deployment is for stateless apps, StatefulSet is for stateful ones. StatefulSets have persistent storage and fixed names. You use StatefulSet for things like databases.

> **Analysis:** Captures the core idea but lacks details on startup order, networking, and volume identity retention.

### ❌ Poor Answer (Score: 1)

They both manage Pods and are mostly the same. You can use either to run your app.

> **Analysis:** Incorrectly assumes both are interchangeable and doesn’t identify the special behaviors of StatefulSets.
