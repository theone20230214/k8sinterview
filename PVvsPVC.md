⚙️ **Kubernetes / Storage – PersistentVolume (PV) vs PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)**
**Question:**
What is the difference between a PersistentVolume (PV) and a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) in Kubernetes? How do they work together?

---

### ✅ Look for:

* **PersistentVolume (PV)** is a cluster resource representing a piece of storage provisioned by an administrator or dynamically.
* **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** is a request for storage by a user, specifying size and access modes.
* PVC binds to a matching PV to provide storage to Pods.
* Decouples storage provisioning from Pod lifecycle, enabling persistent storage.

### Full Score Answer (Score: 5)

A **PersistentVolume (PV)** is a storage resource in the cluster, provisioned either statically by an admin or dynamically via StorageClasses. It represents actual physical storage like NFS, cloud disks, or local storage.

A **PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)** is a user’s request for storage, specifying size, access modes, and optionally storage class. Kubernetes matches the PVC to a suitable PV and binds them.

Pods use PVCs to access the storage, allowing storage to persist independently of Pod lifecycle. This abstraction lets users request storage without needing to know the underlying implementation.

### ⚠️ Medium Answer (Score: 3)

PV is the storage, and PVC is how a Pod asks for storage. PVC links to a PV so Pods can use storage.

> **Analysis:** Covers the basic relationship but misses details on provisioning and binding.

### ❌ Poor Answer (Score: 1)

PV and PVC are the same thing, just different names. They both provide storage to Pods.

> **Analysis:** Incorrectly treats PV and PVC as interchangeable, missing their distinct roles.
